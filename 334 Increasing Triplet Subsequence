1. Right code

class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = float('inf')
        second = float('inf')
        for num in nums:
            if num <= first:
                first = num
            elif num <= second:
                second = num
            else:
                return True
        return False
        
        
2. Thoughts

(1). Noitce that these first and second is NOT the largest two element!  

(2). This code looks easy, but very hard to understand
