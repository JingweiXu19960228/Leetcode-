1. Right code

class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        first = float('inf')
        second = float('inf')
        for num in nums:
            if num <= first:
                first = num
            elif num <= second:
                second = num
            else:
                return True
        return False
        
        
2. Thoughts

(1). Noitce that these first and second is NOT the largest two element!  

(2). This code looks easy, but very hard to understand. There is a good explanation in the youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41gyzVIx-ds)
Please go to at around 5min

(3). Notice that the if else statement is '<=' rather than '<'
