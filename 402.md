1. Right code

```
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        res = []
        
        for i in num:
            while k and res and res[-1] > i:
                res.pop()
                k-=1
            res.append(i)
        
        final_res = res[:-k] if k else res

        return ''.join(final_res).lstrip('0') or '0'
```



2. Thought
(1).  It is intuitive to understand, because the final array would always be monotonically increasing (which is digitally small). 
But I have no clue how to rigorously prove it

(2). It is important whether k would reduce to zero after the while loop. If so, then there is no problem. If not, then it means that there are some digits
we are yet to remove. Since the array is monotonically increasing, we can safely remove from the end of it.

(3). Learn the string function 'lstrip'
