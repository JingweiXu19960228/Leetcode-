1. Right code
```
class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        
        def inorder(node):
            if node:
                return inorder(node.left) + [node.val] + inorder(node.right)
            else:
                return []

        def findtwo(nums):
            x = y = None

            for i in range(len(nums)-1):
                if nums[i+1] < nums[i]:
                    y = nums[i+1]
                    if x == None:
                        x = nums[i]
                    else:
                        break
            return x,y
        

        def swap(node,count):
            if node:
                if node.val == x or node.val == y:
                    node.val = y if node.val == x else x
                    count -= 1
                    if count == 0:
                        return

                swap(node.left,count)
                swap(node.right,count)
  
  
        res = inorder(root)
        x,y = findtwo(res)
        swap(root,2)
```

2. Thoughts

a. In order traversel

Notice that there is only 1 line in the code

b. FindTwo

This algorithm is very clever to find the two swapped element in an almost sorted (descending) array
The 'if' statement would be executed twice in the traversal, and in the 2nd time the the program would break

 
c. Swap

The variable 'count' is used to control the swapping happened exactly 1 time
But I have not figured out what happend when count==0
