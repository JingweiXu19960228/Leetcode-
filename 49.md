   1. WRONG CODE (1st attempt): 
   ``` 
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        def isAnagrams(s:str,t:str):bool:
            a=[0]*26
            for i in s:
                a[ord(i)-ord("a")]+=1
            for i in t:
                a[ord(i)-ord("a")]-=1
            for j in range(26):
                if a[j]!=0:
                    return False
                    break
            return True
         
        for i in len(strs):
            if:
                group_str[j].append(str(i))
        
        return group_str
   ```
   
   I did not know that the data structure like 'dictionary' in python, which supports to use any data type (not included to interger) as key
   
   2. RIGHT CODE (online): 
   ``` 
       def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        d={}
        
        for word in strs:
            sorted_word=''.join(sorted(word))
            if sorted_word in d:
                d[sorted_word].append(word)
            else:
                d[sorted_word]=[word]
        
        return d.values()
   ``` 
   
   Some thoughts on this solution: 
   * The key-value pairs are 'sorted_word' - 'word' 
   This is very clever, because all anagrams would be the same after sorted, which is perfect for a key
   
   * " ''.join() " method is used to convert a list to string, because the return type of sort function is List, which is mutable, 
   and cannot be used as the key in dictionaries
   
  *  Moreover, the values can be anything, so here it is the list of all anagrams, for e.g ['abc','cba']
