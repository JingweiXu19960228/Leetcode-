1. Right code

```
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        rooms = [i for i in Counter(tasks).values()]
        rooms.sort()
        max_freq = rooms.pop()-1
        m = len(tasks)
        idle_room = max_freq * n
        while rooms and idle_room > 0:
            idle_room -= min(rooms.pop(),max_freq)
        return m + max(0,idle_room)
 ```
 
 2. Thoughts
 
 (1). The line inside the while loop is very important. It categorizes the problems into two cases
 Firstï¼š If there is only one element has most occurences, then every time we have idle_room -= rooms.pop /
 
 Second: If there are two elements have most occurences, then the first time idle_room - max_freq. For example, if top two occurrences are A,B, max_freq= 3, n=2 //
 then the initial arrangement should be: "A,B,idle, A,B,idle, A,B".
