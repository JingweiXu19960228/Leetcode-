## The inefficiency of the brute force solution:  


## The insight for a better solution


# 2. Optimized solution
This problem is similar to #27 Remove elements
We can use the 2nd pointer (j) to work on the non-zero elements

Notice that when the iteration is done, we need to assign 0's to the rest (n-j) elements in the end of the array
where n is the length of the array

```
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        i=0
        j=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (nums[i]!=0):
                nums[j]=nums[i]
                j+=1
        for i in range(j,len(nums)):
            nums[i]=0
        
```
